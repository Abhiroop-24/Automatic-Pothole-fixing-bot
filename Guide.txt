
## üõ†Ô∏è Working Guide

This section explains how the autonomous pothole-fixing robot functions step by step, combining **sensor logic**, **motor control**, and **live video streaming**.

---

### üß† 1. Power ON and Initialization

* Power on the **Arduino-based robot** and the **Raspberry Pi 3 B+**.
* Raspberry Pi boots and starts **live video streaming** automatically (if autostart is enabled).
* Arduino initializes all sensors and motors.

---

### üîç 2. Pothole Detection

* The **ultrasonic sensor**, placed at the front center, continuously measures surface height.
* If a significant drop in height is detected (indicating a pothole), the robot triggers alignment mode.

---

### üéØ 3. Alignment Using IR Sensors

* The robot uses **four IR sensors**:

  * `IR_LEFT`, `IR_CENTER_LEFT`, `IR_CENTER_RIGHT`, `IR_RIGHT`
* These sensors help align the robot such that the pothole lies precisely under the **servo-controlled sand gate**.
* IR readings determine if the robot should:

  * **Turn Left** (if more detection on right sensors)
  * **Turn Right** (if more detection on left sensors)
  * **Move Forward** (when centered)

### ü§ñ 4. Movement Control

* Controlled using **4 DC motors**:

  * `M1` (Left Rear), `M2` (Left Front)
  * `M3` (Right Front), `M4` (Right Rear)
* Motor control is handled using an **L293D Motor Driver Shield**, with movement functions coded in Arduino:

  * `moveForward()`, `moveBackward()`
  * `turnLeft()`, `turnRight()`
  * `stopMoving()`

---

### ü™£ 5. Sand Dumping (Pothole Fix)

* Once aligned and directly above the pothole, the robot:

  1. Stops all motors.
  2. Activates the **servo motor** connected to a sand gate.
  3. The servo rotates to release sand into the pothole.
  4. After a few seconds, it closes the gate.

---

### üé• 6. Live Video Streaming (via Raspberry Pi)

* The **Raspberry Pi Camera** captures real-time footage of the process.
* Streaming starts with the `start_stream.sh` script.
* Video is broadcasted over UDP at port `8080` using `ffmpeg`.
* View the stream using VLC:

  ```
  Media ‚Üí Open Network Stream ‚Üí udp://<RPI_IP>:8080
  ```

---

### üîÅ 7. Looping Operation

* After dumping sand, the robot resumes scanning the road for the next pothole.
* This loop continues until the robot is manually stopped or powered off.
